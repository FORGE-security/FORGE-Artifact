### 1.2 Security Assessment Methodology

A group of auditors are involved in the work on the audit. The security engineers check the provided source code independently of each other in accordance with the methodology described below:

#### 1. Project architecture review:

* Project documentation review.
* General code review.
* Reverse research and study of the project architecture on the source code alone.


##### Stage goals 
* Build an independent view of the project's architecture.
* Identifying logical flaws.


#### 2. Checking the code in accordance with the vulnerabilities checklist:

* Manual code check for vulnerabilities listed on the Contractor's internal checklist. The Contractor's checklist is constantly updated based on the analysis of hacks, research, and audit of the cients' codes.
* Code check with the use of static analyzers (i.e Slither, Mythril, etc).

***

##### Stage goal
Eliminate typical vulnerabilities (e.g. reentrancy, gas limit, flash loan attacks etc.).

#### 3. Checking the code for compliance with the desired security model:

* Detailed study of the project documentation.
* Examination of contracts tests.
* Examination of comments in code.
* Comparison of the desired model obtained during the study with the reversed view obtained during the blind audit.
* Exploits PoC development with the use of such programs as Brownie and Hardhat.

##### Stage goal 
Detect inconsistencies with the desired model.


#### 4. Consolidation of the auditors' interim reoprts into one:
* Cross check: each auditor reviews the reports of the others.
* Discussion of the issues found by the auditors.
* Issuance of an interim audit report.

##### Stage goals 
* Double-check all the found issues to make sure they are relevant and the determined threat level is correct.
* Provide the Customer with an interim report.

#### 5. Bug fixing & re-audit:
* The Customer either fixes the issues or provides comments on the issues found by the auditors. Feedback from the Customer must be received on every issue/bug so that the Contractor can assign them a status (either "fixed" or "acknowledged").
* Upon completion of the bug fixing, the auditors double-check each fix and assign it a specific status, providing a proof link to the fix.
* A re-audited report is issued. 

***

##### Stage goals
* Verify the fixed code version with all the recommendations and its statuses.
* Provide the Customer with a re-audited report.

#### 6. Final code verification and issuance of a public audit report: 
* The Customer deploys the re-audited source code on the mainnet.
* The Contractor verifies the deployed code with the re-audited version and checks them for compliance.
* If the versions of the code match, the Contractor issues a public audit report. 

##### Stage goals
* Verify the fixed code version with all the recommendations and its statuses.
* Provide the Customer with a re-audited report.


#### Finding Severity breakdown

All vulnerabilities discovered during the audit are classified based on their potential severity and have the following classification:

Severity | Description
--- | ---
Critical | Bugs leading to assets theft, fund access locking, or any other loss funds to be transferred to any party. 
High     | Bugs that can trigger a contract failure. Further recovery is possible only by manual modification of the contract state or replacement.
Medium   | Bugs that can break the intended contract logic or expose it to DoS attacks, but do not cause direct loss funds.
Low | Bugs that do not have a significant immediate impact and could be easily fixed.

***

Based on the feedback received from the Customer regarding the list of findings discovered by the Contractor, they are assigned the following statuses:

Status | Description
--- | ---
Fixed        | Recommended fixes have been made to the project code and no longer affect its security.
Acknowledged | The Customer is aware of the finding. Recommendations for the finding are planned to be resolved in the future.

### 1.3 Project Overview
`Yearn swaps` is a wrapper for several DEX (currently `1inch`, `Bancor`, `Uniswap`, `ZRX`) intended to be used by `Yearn Vaults` strategies. It provides some common security checks, some centralized management to allow centralized emergency disable of selected swap paths and centralized asyncronous swapping by a trusted account.

Project consists of smart contracts:
- `TradeFactory.sol` - entry point for use by `Yearn Vaults` strategies, management and off-chain bots so-called `Mechanics`. Inherits `TradeFactoryAccessManager.sol` for ACL, `TradeFactoryExecutor.sol` for implementation of swapper interaction, `TradeFactoryPositionsHandler.sol` for management of swap paths and `TradeFactorySwapperHandler.sol` for management of swappers per strategy.

- Directory `swappers/sync` contains several contracts for interaction with specific DEX swappers: `BancorSwapper.sol`, `UniswapV2Swapper.sol`. Additionally, it contains base contract `SyncSwapper.sol` for common syncronous swapper logic.
- Directory `swappers/async` contains similar contracts as above: `AsyncSwappers.sol` and `MultipleAsyncSwapper` as base contracts, `BancorSwapper.sol`, `OneInchAggregatorSwapper.sol`, `UniswapV2Swapper.sol` and `ZRXSwapper.sol` for specific DEX swappers. Async swappers are intended to be called by trusted account, so-called `Mechanics`.

Additionally, project contains some common libraries and base contracts for implementation of access control and utility function like collecting `dust` tokens: `Governable.sol`, `Machinery.sol` and `CollectableDust.sol`

### 1.5 Summary of findings

***

### 1.6 Conclusion
During the audit process, 3 medium and 5 low issues were found by the team of auditors. Also, the developers found and fixed 1 medium issue.

One of the issues, described as Medium 1, grants too much access on `Yearn Vaults` strategies funds to a single centralized account key known as `Mechanic`. To prevent internal security threat, this key should be properly secured, however, it will be permanently accessible by the off-chain technical infrastructure, thus it may be compromised by a persons who performs infrastructure maintenance. This issue was acknowledged by the developers but was not fixed.

Other issues were fixed or acknowledged by the developers. Acknowledged issues make no significant impact on the contract security and perfomance.

## 2. FINDINGS REPORT
### 2.1 Critical
Not found

### 2.2 High
Not found

### 2.3 Medium
#### 1. Security and sanity check bypass in `MultiCallOptimizedSwapper`
##### Status
Acknowledged
##### Description
As well as similar functions, [`execute`](https://github.com/yearn/hardhat-monorepo/blob/ecc0b5147992b34c315e08af170ceb4a5fe071ee/packages/yswaps/contracts/TradeFactory/TradeFactoryExecutor.sol#L126) performs several sanity and security checks:
- provided swapper is required to be in `_swappers` enumerable set
- exchange path `tokenIn` and `tokenOut` is required to be enabled for given `strategy`
- output token amount is required to be greater or equal to provided `minAmountOut`.

However, the actual code executed by [`_executeSwap`](https://github.com/yearn/hardhat-monorepo/blob/ecc0b5147992b34c315e08af170ceb4a5fe071ee/packages/yswaps/contracts/swappers/async/MultiCallOptimizedSwapper.sol#L27) is arbitrary and can accidentally or intentionally bypass these checks. Although `MultiCallOptimizedSwapper` can be only invoked by the trusted actor `onlyMechanics`, arbitrary code execution can probably lead to loss of funds in case of accidental bug at off-chain bot. Also, single compromised `Mechanic` account key can lead to "rug pull" from all connected strategies.
##### Recommendation
We recommend to disallow execution of arbitrary code and keep the best practice of white-listing of allowed actions and calls, similar to other swappers at `contracts/swappers/async` directory.
##### Client's commentary
We decided to maintain the MultiCallOptimizedSwapper as is.

#### 2. Unnecessary and unrestricted `trade()` at `sync/BancorSwapper`
##### Status
Fixed at https://github.com/yearn/hardhat-monorepo/commit/442934a414c2672cfeb998bd1a930b61145f2010
##### Description
[trade()](https://github.com/yearn/hardhat-monorepo/blob/ecc0b5147992b34c315e08af170ceb4a5fe071ee/packages/yswaps/contracts/swappers/sync/BancorSwapper.sol#L52) function has no use and most likely remains in contract by an accident. However, it is unrestricted and can be called by anyone. 
##### Recommendation
Although we have not found any attack vector for this issue, we recommend to remove this code to improve security.

#### 3. Incompatibility with fee-on-transfer tokens
##### Status
Acknowledged

***

##### Description
Several parts of code have assumption that `transferFrom(..., amount)` will result in receiving of exact `amount` of tokens:

- https://github.com/yearn/hardhat-monorepo/blob/ecc0b5147992b34c315e08af170ceb4a5fe071ee/packages/yswaps/contracts/TradeFactory/TradeFactoryExecutor.sol#L82-L88
- https://github.com/yearn/hardhat-monorepo/blob/ecc0b5147992b34c315e08af170ceb4a5fe071ee/packages/yswaps/contracts/TradeFactory/TradeFactoryExecutor.sol#L111-L117

However, actual amount of received tokens can be less for fee-on-transfer tokens.
##### Recommendation
For compatibility with fee-on-transfer tokens we recommend to use `balanceOf` to obtain actual amounts of tokens received by `transferFrom`. 
##### Client's commentary
We will not support fee on trasfer tokens.

#### 4. Incorrect slippage check
##### Status
Fixed at https://github.com/yearn/hardhat-monorepo/pull/62/commits/7a044d425932e735898209ed80185c86ffde0042
##### Description
Condition in slippage check is logically reversed: 
https://github.com/yearn/hardhat-monorepo/blob/ecc0b5147992b34c315e08af170ceb4a5fe071ee/packages/yswaps/contracts/TradeFactory/TradeFactoryExecutor.sol#L150
##### Recommendation
Note: this issue was found by the developers

***

### 2.4 Low
#### 1. Unrestricted setter in `Machinery` contract
##### Status
Fixed at https://github.com/yearn/hardhat-monorepo/commit/ad915949c814da73c445337da76c6503d7bac32a
##### Description
Setter for the mechanics registry [setMechanicsRegistry](https://github.com/yearn/hardhat-monorepo/blob/ecc0b5147992b34c315e08af170ceb4a5fe071ee/packages/contract-utils/contracts/utils/Machinery.sol#L22) has no access restriction. It can cause security breach in inherited contracts that lack security-aware override of `setMechanicsRegistry` function.
##### Recommendation
Although currently all of the inherited contracts from audited scope override `setMechanicsRegistry` properly, we recommend to prevent accidental inheritance of insecure code by modifying or removing `setMechanicsRegistry` function from `Machinery` contract. Additionally, this contract is most likely has been planned to be `abstract`.
##### Client's commentary
Took out biz logic of setMechanicsRegistry contract, and converted it to an abstract, so it must be implemented by those who inherit it.

#### 2. Unnecessary assembly in `MultiCallOptimizedSwapper.sol`
##### Status
Acknowledged

***

##### Description
[MultiCallOptimizer.sol](https://github.com/yearn/hardhat-monorepo/blob/ecc0b5147992b34c315e08af170ceb4a5fe071ee/packages/yswaps/contracts/swappers/async/MultiCallOptimizedSwapper.sol) contract is using assembly most likely for gas optimization purposes. However, this approach does not make significant impact to overall gas usage while it makes the code more complex and unsafe.
##### Recommendation
In favour of readability and safety of code. we recommend to avoid unnecessary usage of assembly in Solidity.
##### Client's commentary
We decided to maintain the MultiCallOptimizedSwapper as is.

#### 3. Variables can be declared as immutable
##### Status
Fixed at https://github.com/yearn/hardhat-monorepo/commit/635ce3dbdcc565a55eb2cdb791efcbf05637a2ec
##### Description
Following variables of both sync and async Bancor swappers can be declared as immutable: `contractRegistry`, `bancorNetworkName` at https://github.com/yearn/hardhat-monorepo/blob/ecc0b5147992b34c315e08af170ceb4a5fe071ee/packages/yswaps/contracts/swappers/async/BancorSwapper.sol#L40-L41 and `contractRegistry`, `bancorNetworkName` at https://github.com/yearn/hardhat-monorepo/blob/ecc0b5147992b34c315e08af170ceb4a5fe071ee/packages/yswaps/contracts/swappers/sync/BancorSwapper.sol#L38-L39
##### Recommendation
We recommend to declare mentioned variables as immutable.

***

#### 4. Duplicating sanity check

Fixed at https://github.com/yearn/hardhat-monorepo/commit/5a99d094068b42b63a4e8e42862d4539716c555e
##### Description
Sanity check `maxSlippage != 0` at https://github.com/yearn/hardhat-monorepo/blob/ecc0b5147992b34c315e08af170ceb4a5fe071ee/packages/yswaps/contracts/TradeFactory/TradeFactoryExecutor.sol#L81 duplicates sanity check at https://github.com/yearn/hardhat-monorepo/blob/ecc0b5147992b34c315e08af170ceb4a5fe071ee/packages/yswaps/contracts/swappers/sync/SyncSwapper.sol#L38
##### Recommendation
We recommend to remove redundant check

#### 5. Redundant operation on return values
##### Status
Fixed at https://github.com/yearn/hardhat-monorepo/commit/09d1bcfc22e2ceae46467b40db8c72ac1c0f0091, https://github.com/yearn/hardhat-monorepo/commit/e933fcb4b64548200e8090bc9cbbf54c7119bc7b
##### Description
Here are performed some redundant operation on return values of `swapExactTokensForTokens()`:

It makes no impact on contract security or perfomance and only noted in favour of graceful code.
##### Recommendation
We recommend to remove redundant operations
