 * Maintains a whitelist for calls that can be made from an AssetVault.

 * functions while an asset is being held in escrow. Some functions
 * are blacklisted, e.g. transfer functions, to prevent callers from
 * being able to circumvent withdrawal rules for escrowed assets.
 * Whitelists are specified in terms of "target contract" (callee)
 * and function selector.
 *
 * The contract owner can add or remove items from the whitelist.
